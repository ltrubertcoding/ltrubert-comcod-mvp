            <h3 style="color: white;">Guy Ramsay Fieri is an American restaurateur, author, and an Emmy Award winning
                television presenter. He co-owns three restaurants in California, licenses his name to restaurants in
                New York City and Las Vegas, Nevada, and is known for hosting various television series on the Food
                Network.By mid-2010, the Food Network had made Fieri the "face of the network". In 2010, The New York
                Times reported that Fieri brought an "element of rowdy, mass-market culture to American food
                television", and that his "prime-time shows attract more male viewers than any others on the network".

            <h2 style="color: white;">Spicy Locations</h2>
            <h3 style="color: white;">In late 1996, Fieri and business partner Steve Gruber opened Johnny Garlic's, a
                "California Pasta Grill" in Santa Rosa, California. A second location opened in Windsor in 1999, a third
                in Petaluma in 2000 or 2001 (since closed), and a fourth in Roseville in late 2008. Subsequently, they
                developed Tex Wasabi's (barbecue and sushi) in 2003 in Santa Rosa, adding a second location in
                Sacramento's Arden-Arcade area in 2007 (which was rebranded as Johnny Garlic's, and then subsequently
                closed). An additional Johnny Garlic's was opened in Dublin, California, in 2011. His first New York
                City restaurant, Guy's American Kitchen and Bar, opened in 2012 to scathing New York Times coverage by
                Pete Wells that Larry Olmsted of Forbes called "the most scathing review in the history of the New York
                Times", and "likely the most widely read restaurant review ever." Fieri, for his part, accused Wells,
                the nation's highest profile reviewer, of using Fieri's fame as a platform for advancing his own
                prestige. Despite appearing on Restaurant Business's list of the top 100 independent restaurants as
                ranked by sales for four years in a row, the restaurant announced plans to close at the end of 2017. In
                2011, Fieri partnered with Carnival Cruise lines to create Guy's Burger Joint to sell Fieri's burgers
                fleet-wide. As of October 2017, there were 19 restaurants on Carnival's cruise ships, including some
                serving beer-and-BBQ, Guy's Pig & Anchor Smokehouse Brewhouse. Check out the just a few of the many
                resturaunts owned by our lord and saviour:
